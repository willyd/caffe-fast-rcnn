# Caffe Windows Fork

This is a fork of Caffe that introduces support for building with Visual Studio. This library is best built with [caffe-builder](https://github.com/willyd/caffe-builder). I would like to give special thanks to @niuzhiheng for the initial Windows port and @happynear for providing parts of the Windows specific implementation. 

### Volunteers wanted!
There is ongoing work to make the Windows bits included in the upstream project but this is too much work for a single person. If you are interested in contributing please let me know.

## News (2015-09-22)

* Added support for building Matlab bindings
* Added support for building with Ninja based generators
* Added experimental support for building with CuDNN
